#  Core data inside other framework

This is a mini project meant to be used as reference for the future.

It showcases how to put CoreData logic & model inside a different framework so we can benefit from compiling speed up, though not sure if is a big gain.

I had troubles setting this up since entities weren't being generated/found, after cleaning up the project it worked, which isn't very reassuring (its seems fragile and headache-prone ...)
